"""Magnet URI parsing, reduced to the one field the downloads feature tracks.

The BitTorrent info hash is what ties a magnet we submitted to the offline
task CloudDrive reports back, so it is extracted once at submit time and used
as the join key from then on. Hashes are normalized to upper-case hex,
because the same torrent is advertised as hex by some sources and base32 by
others.
